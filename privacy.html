  <h1>Electricymeter Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p>Electricymeter (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a meter-reading and building management application designed to help residents, property managers and service providers collaborate efficiently. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use Electricymeter on mobile or web. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information that you provide directly and data generated through your use of the service, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong> – name, email address, authentication identifiers (email/password, social login IDs), organization or building information, and any profile information you choose to add.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – meter readings, uploaded documents or photos, comments, tasks, and other records entered inside the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & analytics data</strong> – device model, operating system version, app version, language, IP address, and events related to app performance and feature usage. We collect this via Firebase and similar analytics tools to maintain service quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Support data</strong> – information you share when contacting us for assistance, including screenshots or diagnostic details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate users and secure access to the service.</li>
    <li>Deliver app functionality, e.g., storing meter readings, generating reports, syncing with other users, and sending notifications.</li>
    <li>Manage billing or administrative tasks linked to your building or organization.</li>
    <li>Monitor app usage, troubleshoot issues, and plan improvements.</li>
    <li>Communicate updates, respond to support requests, and provide relevant notices.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authorized collaborators</strong> – other users you invite or who are assigned to your building (e.g., property managers, service personnel) can see data necessary to fulfill their roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> – trusted third parties (e.g., Firebase, hosting providers, email/SMS vendors) that process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal authorities</strong> – if required by law, regulation, legal process, or government request.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> – in connection with mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, subject to continued protection of personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data for as long as your account remains active or as needed to deliver the service. We may also retain information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When data is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account settings</strong> – you can update profile information and notification preferences within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Access/Deletion requests</strong> – contact us to request a copy of your data, correct inaccuracies, or delete your account (subject to legal or contractual restrictions).</li>
    <li><strong>Consent withdrawal</strong> – if you previously consented to optional data collection or marketing, you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Device permissions</strong> – mobile platforms allow you to manage camera, storage, or notification permissions; disabling some permissions may limit app features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We implement technical and organizational measures, including encryption in transit, secure data storage, access controls, and routine security reviews. However, no system is completely secure; use the app responsibly and keep your login credentials confidential.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>The service may process or store data on servers located outside your country. By using Electricymeter, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection laws, while we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Electricymeter is not intended for use by children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn we have done so, we will delete the information promptly.</p>

  <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>
